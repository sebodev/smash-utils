Info for developers of this script:

Execution starts with the smash.bat or smash.sh file, and continues to the runner/runner.py file

If you would like to add a new command, add a file to the wordpress_utils or maintenance_utils folder
You will then need to add a new entry to runner/runner.py to call your python file
You will also need to add an argparse entry in runner/get_cmd_line_options.py

You will want to take a look at what's in the runner/smash_vars.py module. There are some useful pieces of info stored in there like
the locations of folders where smash-utils stores data
and various pieces of info that have been stored in config files.
Also the lib/webfaction.py module is pretty handy for interacting with Webfaction.
You can also use the lib/passwords module to find various types of passwords.
