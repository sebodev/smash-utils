Info for developers of this script:

Execution starts with the smash.bat or smash.sh file, and continue to the runner/runner.py file

If you would like to add a new command, add a file to the wordpress_utils or maintenance_utils folder
You will then need to add a new entry to the runner/runner.py for your script
You will also need to add an argparse entry in runner/get_cmd_line_options.py

There isn't much boilerplate and any of the utils modules could easily be made to run without being called by the runner which is nice.

You will want to take a look at what's in the runner/vars.py module. It has the location to store user specific data
along with various pieces of info that have been stored in config files.
Also the lib/webfaction.py module is pretty handy for interacting with Webfaction.
You can get any password you need with the lib/lastpass.find() function
